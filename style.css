In this example:

We're using Bootstrap for basic layout components and grid system.
Custom styles are added for the colored boxes.
Media queries are used to adjust the width of the boxes based on the screen size. The boxes will take up 100% of the width by default and then adjust to 50%, 33.33%, and 25% respectively as the screen size increases.
